My research interest is recovering the trajecotries of multiple rigid bodies and camera from RGB-D sequences in dynamic environments. Before comming to the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), I have completed my undergraduate study in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
