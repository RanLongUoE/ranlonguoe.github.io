I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in the [SLMC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc) group and is supervied by [Professor Sethu Vijayakumar FRSE](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/). My research interest is recovering the trajecotries of multiple rigid bodies from RGB-D sequences using the understanding of robots' actions, such as robot proprioception or kinematic. Before comming to the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), I have completed my undergraduate study in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
