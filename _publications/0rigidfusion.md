# excerpt: 'RigidFusion is a state-of-the-art dense SLAM method that is robust to large dynamic occlusion (over 65%) in the scene, without requiring prior shape or appearance of the dynamic objects. It also contributes a pipeline to simultaneously segment, track and reconstruct the static background and one dynamic rigid body from RGB-D sequences. Importantly, we open source the dataset with the camera and object ground truth trajectories to further inspire other researchers’ work in the area of SLAM in dynamic environments.'
